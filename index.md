**Bachelor's in Environmental Science**\
*Simmons University* - Expected Graduation: May 2027

I'm passionate about the environment though unsure about what I want to do professionally after college.

I have a moderate understanding of R, including

- Tidyverse
- Linear regressions

I am using this Portfolio to showcase any and all R projects I have worked on during my college education.

### Projects

- [Energy Report](https://github.com/Alexa-J-Pike/MiniProject_1.git): Are the Top Polluting Countries Embracing Renewables?\
This project analyzes the top three polluting countries, China, the US, and India, and
seeks to determine if or at what rate they are replacing nonrenewable energies (oil, gas, etc.)
with renerable ones (solar, wind, etc).

- Data Wrangling Tutorial: What Game Will Nintendo Make Next?\
This R tutorial walks beginner R users through DPLYR, the data transformation package
contained in the Tidyverse.
