I'm passionate about the environment, though I am unsure about what I want to do professionally after college.

I have a moderate understanding of R, including

- Tidyverse
- Linear regressions

I am using this Portfolio to showcase any and all R projects I have worked on during my college education.

### Projects

- [Energy Report](https://github.com/Alexa-J-Pike/MiniProject_1.git): Are the Top Polluting Countries Embracing Renewables?\
This project analyzes the top three polluting countries, China, the US, and India, and seeks to determine if or at what rate they are replacing nonrenewable energies (oil, gas, etc.) with renewable ones (solar, wind, etc).

- [Data Wrangling Tutorial](https://github.com/Alexa-J-Pike/MiniProject_2.git): What Game Will Nintendo Make Next?\
This R tutorial walks beginner R users through DPLYR, the data transformation package contained in the Tidyverse. 

- [Student Habits Report](link): How Sleeping and Studying Affect Student Grades.\
This project analyzes how sleep and study habits affect exam grades and develops a predictive model to help students estimate whether they will pass or fail based on their hours of sleep and study.
